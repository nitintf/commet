## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting (macOS)

If you see a security error after installing with Homebrew (e.g., "commet cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"), run:

```sh
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /opt/homebrew/bin/commet
```

This removes the Apple quarantine attribute from the binary.
